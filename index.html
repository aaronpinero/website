					<p>Okay, a piece of really poor UX design is driving me mad: in the Apple Music app, I cannot tell, just by looking at it, if the "Favorite" button is showing that I have 'favorited' the song or not. Worse, I think the button has a different appearance depending on whether or not you are in the app or in the control center. It is a little trivial detail in a very big app but it is nettlesome.</p>

					<p>It is a useful reminder that the best creative work often occurs as a result of project constraints that initially seem quite limiting. Constraints are guardrails protecting against a lack of focus and a substrate for crystallization of ideas.</p>

					<p>If I am using ChatGPT or Google Gemini or GitHub Copilot to get answers to code questions or examples of code – which I always check against documentation before using – am I learning new code techniques in the process? Or do these tools serve as a crutch that will ultimately make me a weaker programmer?</p>

					<p>I was thinking about how the show <i>Severence</i> lives in the shadow cast by David Lynch and <i>Twin Peaks</i>. I hope that the <i>Severance</i> show runners draw some wisdom from the past and choose not to give us all the answers. Let Lumon keep some mysteries. It’s what he would do.</p>

					<p>Was reading about CSS <code>text-box</code> (from Friday Front-End) and I can see isolated cases where it would be useful. But <a href="/tyfy/docs/index.html">my own framework</a> is all about creating a useful baseline grid. Using <code>text-box</code> would seem to make that an impossible goal. I’m not a fan.</p>

					<p>Does <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> really require you to be building an app from some sort of framework? Is there no vanilla HTML/CSS implementation? What an immediate turn-off. I was considering replacing <a href="https://fractal.build">Fractal</a> (which might no longer be maintained?) but hard pass on Storybook.</p>

					<p>I rode a stationary bike this morning for my workout instead of going outside to ride because of snow and salt and wind and sub-freezing temperatures so my hands and feet were nice and toasty but *damn* it sucked. I could use some warmer weather (just a little warmer) or a real solution to frozen toes.</p>

					<p>Basic driving skills and common courtesy are severely lacking. No one can signal before turning, stay in their lane, park in a single space. No one obeys the speed limit, stop signs, red lights. It’s gotten really bad.</p>

					<p>Google Gemini Deep Research and related tools are going to have a significant impact on academia. Hard o say right now if that will be a good or bad thing but our track record with technology is – to be kind – mixed.</p>

					<p>Why is it that YouTube video reviews of cycling gear are mostly presented by people in the UK? Does no one in the US care as much? Is all the good cycling gear made for European consumers?</p>
